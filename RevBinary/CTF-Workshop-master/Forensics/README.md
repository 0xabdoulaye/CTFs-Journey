# CTF-Workshop - Forensics
This is a repository of Forensics challenges designed to introduce common practices and methods used when working on CTF Forensics challenges. Within the `Challenges` directory of this folder you will find the binary files for each of the challenges. Inside of the `Writeups` directory you will find the writeups and solution files for each of the challenges.

## Requirements
It is suggested that you have a hex editor for many of these challenges. In particular, 010 Editor is highly suggested for it's scripting and template capabilities. It is also suggested that you are proficient in at least one programming language. The most common languages for writeups in this repository will be C/C++ and Python.

## Difficulty and Progression
Because of the nature of forensics, difficulty is often _**extremely**_ opinionated. Therefore, therefore instead of grouping the challenges by difficulty, they will be grouped by the subject of the method used to solve the challenge. Challenges that have multiple steps that use multiple methods will have the writeup split and linked to the appropriate group for continuation of the challenge.

## Setup
If there is a solution where C/C++ is used to solve the challenge, a `Makefile` will be provided within the writeup directory. Any specific libraries required for the solution scripts (if any) will be noted in the `Readme` for the writeup.
